# 01-Guessing
This is an exercise in creating a number guessing game. The purpose is to teach me simple coding such as data types and control structure.

You are asked to guess a number between 1 and 100 and then the system should hint to you whether your number you guessed is too high or too low. You can guess infinitley until you guess the right number. Once guessed, the game informs the player of how many guesses it took the player to guess it correctly. Then you are prompted with whether or not you want to continue playing the game.
